# Step 2: connect to Firestore

We start to build a simple webpage which lists all messages stored in `messages` collection.
Navigate to [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a database in Firebase with Testing mode.
Once the database is created, create a collection named `messages` and create some documents under the collection.
Each collection should have `name (string)`, `text (string)`, and `timestamp (datetime)` fields.
Input dummy values in each field and save.
